# ExchangeLogisticsApp
Basic app for a logistics company with built in freight echange built with:
 - python
 - django - server side rendering
 - bootstrap - carousel templates
 
 In this basic app we have three common templates where the information of the logistics company is displayed.
 I have put some basic text in the teplates in order for the app to start without creating a superuser.
 I have created also three models for the basic data regarding the company which can be used, but only after a superuser is creted.
 Using the admin page we can add the desired information and then render it to the teplates ( see the lines marked as comments on the common templates)
 
 The second feature of the app is a freight exchange where registered users can publish their loads or free trucks.
 A user can sign up with username and password. After that a blank profile is created and the user should fill the neccessary data for his profile.
 After that he can publish freight or truck offers on the market.
 Every offer includes information about the company that posted it and also a link to the company's profile, so that other companies can access it and see all of the actual offers on the market.
